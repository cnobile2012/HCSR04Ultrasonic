This is a rework of the library created by ITead studio. Alex, Apr 20, 2010.
iteadstudio.com

The API has changed so the name of the package has changed from Ultrasonic to
HCSR04Ultrasonic.

1) I have changed the method names to a more conventional naming standard.
2) The global defines are now public static const member objects on the class.
   This takes them out of the global name space so the potential of collisions
   with other libraries should not happen.

In general look at the code and examples to understand the changes.
